This project simulates shopping online. 

I implemented setIntersection and setUnion in util.cpp. They run in nlogn time. I also wrote derived classes: book, clothing, and movie. In addition, I implemented myDatastore, which is a derived class from datastore. Finally, I edited amazon.cpp to add the missing commands and edited the Makefile to correctly compile with my new files.
